            <h4 class="text-pink-500"><strong>About</strong></h4>
            <p class="my-4 text-gray-100">I have been working as a full-time tennis umpire since 2013 and have traveled
                to more than 40 countries
                around the world. During the pandemic I stayed at home in Gothenburg and fell in love with my home town,
                I realized how much I enjoy being at home so I started thinking that maybe there are more things than
                tennis in my life. It was time to try something new. </p>
            <p class="my-6">In january 2021 I started working for Gelateria Positano as a store manager and chief of
                staff. It was
                nice to try something else, I enjoyed meeting costumers and taking care of all employees. However, being
                responsible for three stores and 20+ employees + working full time in the store was heavy and I could
                never stop thinking about my job. After a few months I injured my wrist scooping gelato. That's when I
                knew that this was not the right place for me to be. I began thinking about education and what I wanted
                to do when I came across Medieinstitutet.</p>
            <p class="my-6">During my trip to Japan working the 2020 Tokyo Paralympic Games I started to prepare for the
                next chapter
                in my life, the road of becoming a Front End Developer.</p>


            <h4 class="text-pink-500 p-"><strong>Work</strong></h4>
            <p class="my-4">Since Im brand new to web development I have not got too much experience yet. However you
                may take a look
                at my GiyHub page to check out my projects!</p>
            <p>I am looking for an Internship for fall 2020.</p>
